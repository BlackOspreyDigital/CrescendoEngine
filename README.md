Built with Vulkan and SDL2

This project is aimed at bringing Vulkan Graphics to all in a simple SDL2 layer. Both Arch Linux and Windows can build this program, see guides for more info. Engine is currently under pre alpha build, lots of tools and features are not yet implemented. There will be a roadmap released as soon as engine enters proof of concept. More information to come!
